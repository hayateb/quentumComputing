Superposition in quantum computing means that a qubit can exist in multiple states (like |0⟩ and |1⟩) at the same time.

A constant function is a function that always returns the same output bit (either 0 or 1), no matter what input is given to it.

A balanced function is a function that returns 0 for half of the inputs and 1 for the other half, depending on the input state of the qubit.

Interference can be constructive or destructive based on the likelehood of their outcome result.

Hadamard Gate an operation applied to qubits to created superpostion of them 

Entaglement is the state that is between two qubits which one affect the other one 
and they communicate each other with pairment they have .
